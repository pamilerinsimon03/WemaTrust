## üéØ The Problem

**Challenge Track:** E-Channels & Transaction Reliability  
**Challenge Question:**  
> How might we shield customers from internal system complexities and make every digital transaction feel instant and completely reliable, even when failures occur behind the scenes?

## ‚ú® Our Solution

Our project, **Instant-Feel Transactions**, is a prototype mobile banking app (built with Wema Bank colors) designed to **preserve customer trust during transaction delays**.  

Key features:
- **Proactive Communication:** Clear push + SMS notifications before, during, and after transactions (e.g., if a destination bank is slow or down).  
- **Shadow Balance (MoneyBox):** Incoming transfers appear instantly as a "pending balance" visible to customers, even if they aren‚Äôt yet fully cleared. Customers see proof of the transaction without being able to spend until confirmed.  
- **Monitoring & Transparency:** Simple dashboard showing partner bank statuses (UP / SLOW / DOWN). Users can check via app or USSD.  
- **Fallback Channels:** SMS + USSD support for feature-phone users or during poor internet conditions.  

This way, customers always see **instant feedback** on their money ‚Äî turning potential frustration into **trust and confidence**.
